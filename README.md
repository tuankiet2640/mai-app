## Architecture & Integration

```
[User]
   |
[mai-app (React)]
   |
   | REST/Socket.IO
   v
[mai-services (Spring Boot)] <--- JWT Auth ---> [rag-service (FastAPI)]
```

- All API data fetching/mutations use RTK Query hooks from `/features/api/` (see [frontend best practices](../README.master.md)).
- Auth tokens and user info are stored in localStorage after login.
- mai-app communicates with mai-services for authentication, user management, and chat.
- Knowledge base queries are routed to rag-service, authenticated with JWT from mai-services.

## Authentication

- Login with username/password (not email)
- Tokens (`accessToken`, `refreshToken`) and user object are returned from mai-services
- Tokens are stored in localStorage
- All API requests (including to rag-service) include `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
- Admin credentials for development: `admin` / `admin123`
## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tuankiet2640/mai-app.git
cd mai-app
```
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```
The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

- Ensure mai-services and rag-service are running (see [README.master.md](../README.master.md))
- Configure API base URLs in `.env.local` as needed.
